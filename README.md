# 🖼️ Text-to-Image Generator using Stable Diffusion 2.1

Turn your words into art with the power of **AI and Stable Diffusion**. This project uses the `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base` model combined with an interactive **Gradio UI** to generate high-quality images from natural language prompts.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Real-time text-to-image generation
- 🎨 Supports creative, fantasy, realistic, and abstract styles
- 🧠 Powered by Hugging Face `diffusers` and `torch.float16` precision
- 🖥️ GPU deployment via `pipe.to("cuda")`
- 🖱️ Clean and interactive Gradio interface
- ⚙️ Optimized with `EulerDiscreteScheduler` for faster and more stable outputs
